        Hello, This is Luis Espejo. Luis and I have been friends for about two
        years. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Luis Espejo and I have been friends for the past two years. He is a
        Venezuelan native. Because of the civil instability in Venezuela, Luis
        relocated to the United States. Just like most Immigrates coming to the
        United States from non-English speaking countries, He has had his own
        challenges with English and, of course, challenges of transitioning.
        Regardless of all those challenges, Luis triumphs. Luis now works and
        speaks English fluently.
      </p>
      
      <p class="intro-text">
        Luis is quite a busy man, he works six days a week. However, he managed
        to do so much in the little time he gets. Fun fact, Luis and I met at a
        soccer field after his team lost to my team. Luis plays goalkeeper for a
        local second-division team. Luis is also the captain and goalkeeper for
        Team Venezuela in the International Unity Cup league hosted every summer
        in the city to bring people together.
